                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed a Blue Prism automation purposed to monitor the stress of other Blue Prism automations 
                                released intothe production environment. This automation was equipped to assign DVD resources to 
                                the automations that were heavily taxed or near breach of SLA.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Proposed design enhancements to existing POC</li>
                                    <li>Acted as the sole developer</li>
                                    <li>Created a test plan and coordinated with the automation tester during the UAT phase</li>
                                    <li>Assisted with creating user stories in Digital AI’s project management tool, VersionOne</li>
                                    <li>Created configuration files that contained key startup and shut down parameters for the 
                                        automation</li>
                                    <li>Leveraged SQL DB and Oracle DB querying for real time data on the applications running 
                                        in production, such as: queues backlogs, automation status, and automation schedules</li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>Automated Configuration File Deployment
                        <ul>
                            <li>This project succeeded in fully automating the Blue Prism deployment process. It served as an addition to the 
                                existing automated deployment of Blue Prism packages into the production environment. 
                                Every Blue Prism process in the production environment was designed with a configuration file dependency. 
                                These files were manually deployed by production support alongside the automated package deployment until the 
                                completion of this project, which tracked the request for configuration file deployments in ServiceNow via API call, 
                                retrieved the files from a landing zone, deployed the files to their target location, then finally closing the 
                                associated tasks in ServiceNow via API call. My contributions include:
